Q3) I would use a library called pyinstaller https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/ to package the script 
into an executable. I could add a simple interface that allows for input of a parquet file, 
and map and lets you outline and label the differnet boundary of interest(s) directly onto the map. 
I can then take the coordinates from the outline to use for the boundaries to check from while taking
an input for what team/side/area is requested.
